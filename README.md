# Hello Tovarishi
This is an early version of rebalance mod that aims to enchance (in my opinion) CE Custom Ammo mod, if you have ever used it and found it to be quite cool, but useless at the same time you are not alone, and this patch is made to change this.\
At the current state only 4 materials were changed: Plasteel, Steel, Synthelene and Uranium. Other materials are in "to do" list, maybe.\
Any suggestions are very much appreciated, so go on if you have any.
# How to install 
1.Download patch and put it into mod folder.

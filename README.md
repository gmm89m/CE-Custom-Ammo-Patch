# Hello Tovarishi
This is an early version of rebalance mod that aims to enchance (in my opinion) CE Custom Ammo mod (available at, https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3614768269&searchtext=), if you have ever used it and found it to be quite cool, but useless at the same time you are not alone, and this patch is made to change this.\
At the current state only 4 materials were changed: Plasteel, Steel, Synthelene and Uranium. Other materials are in "to do" list, maybe.\
Any suggestions are very much appreciated, so go on if you have any.

# So, what exactly is this mod doing?
Firstly, it replaces the FMJ with AP when avalaible, this makes AP a point to start from for further modification.\
In addition to that, it patches early mentioned materials and powderload effects.

# How to install 
1.Download original mod https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3614768269&searchtext= \
2.Download CE Custom Ammo patch and put it into mod folder.

# Things to know and be aware of
If you were using your custom ammo it may affect your save, in a bad way obviously, so don't try to delete ammo you made and used, and of course do not uninstall mod mid-game.\
To avoid savekilling cases, just keep backup save were this and original mods haven't been used.
